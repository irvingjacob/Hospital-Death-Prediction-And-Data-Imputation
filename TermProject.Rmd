```{r setup, include=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
source("/Users/jacobmitchell/Documents/STAT6440/functions/myfunctions.R")
hospital <- read.csv("/Users/jacobmitchell/Documents/STAT6440/csvs/dataset.csv")
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(caret)
hospital$hospital_death <- as.factor(hospital$hospital_death)
levels(hospital$hospital_death) <- c("0", "1")
hospital <- subset(hospital, select = -c(encounter_id, patient_id, hospital_id, X))
```
## Partitioning the Data
```{r partition}
RNGkind(sample.kind = "Rounding")
set.seed(0) ## set seed so that you get same partition each time
p2 <- partition.2(hospital, 0.7) ## creating 70:30 partition
training.data <- p2$data.train
test.data <- p2$data.test
```
## Note about initial variable selection
encounter_id, patient_id, hospital_id, X all seem to not hold information worth regressing or building a model on, so these can be dropped. 

## Feature Selection
We have a model that has 85 features. This is a large amount of potential regressors for a logistic regression model. Given this, we are going to use LASSO to limit our feature selection.
```{r lasso}
library(glmnet)
# convert data to matrix type
trainX <- as.matrix(training.data[, -81])
testX <- as.matrix(test.data[, -81])
trainY <- training.data$hospital_death
lasso <- glmnet(x = trainX, y = trainY, alpha = 1, family = "binomial")
plot(lasso, xvar = "lambda", main = "Lasso regression")
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
